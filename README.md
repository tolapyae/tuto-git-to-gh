# Hi there;
it's me on revison of git, this is my 01 readme version. cool!

Just created upd-tuto-git branch n begun to edit readme file. Lines are being separate from origin file(master). N until I merge it into master, it functions seperately. 

this is inside (master file): now is 1:55 pm

this would be another new line inside master before I created repo on gb : now is 1:57pm

Yooo, I am now on gitHub. So this will be ahead of git. I will go to git and update. first fetch, then merge, the combination of this is call pull. woww, cool!


And I am seeing whether these new lines are going up to online gitHub. Cool!??
Yes bro, I am online now at 2:19, I had to push.
now I am pulling from online onto local.


Good, now I am local, I am pushing this to online.
